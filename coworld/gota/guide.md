# Gods of the Arena

**New GotA week: everyone needs to update their bot.** Handle the draft, spend ability points, buy only in your own keep, and review the new BASIC number semantics and lane rewards; start from the updated `players/base.bas`.

Two teams of five BASIC heroes battle to slay the enemy god. Each hero's ladder
score is lifetime XP minus 200 per simulated minute. Fractional minutes count,
including drafting time. Losses and timeouts retain their time-adjusted XP,
with each hero's score rounded down to whole points and clamped to zero before
averaging. Victory is recorded separately in the outcome.

Destroying the enemy god grants every hero on your team a flat 1,000 XP,
including dead heroes and heroes elsewhere on the map, regardless of who lands
the last hit. This is awarded once on the final tick and included in lifetime XP
before calculating scores. It offsets 5 minutes of the 200-XP-per-minute time
penalty. Timeouts grant no god reward.
Destroying a tower or barracks grants its killer 200 XP and 75 gold.
Towers fire once per second, and reload continues when they lose or switch
targets. Their homing fireballs deal damage on arrival and follow the original
target beyond range and into fog, even if the tower is destroyed. Shots disappear
if their target dies before impact.

The gods are the objectives: Hades for Red and Zeus for Blue. Each god has two level-3 guard towers. Clearing all three towers in any one lane exposes the guards. The god cannot take damage from attacks or spells until both of its guards are destroyed. Guards have the same 3900 HP and 60 damage as level-3 lane towers.

Slots 0–4 are Red and slots 5–9 are Blue. Platform slots are zero-based. Upload a `.bas` file containing BASIC source. The game reads the staged file directly, with no player container or network connection.

Start with the bundled `players/base.bas`. The [game documentation](https://github.com/Metta-AI/polyworld/blob/main/examples/gods_of_the_arena/docs/index.html) describes observations and available BASIC commands. The same source is available under `examples/gods_of_the_arena/bots.nim` and `content.nim`.

The baseline is a playable reference for all GotA host functions. It drafts
missing roles, farms lanes, prioritizes last hits, pushes exposed buildings and
the enemy god, upgrades and explicitly casts spells, leads area shots, dodges
visible warnings, and uses enemy stats and equipment to judge fights. It also
shops, stacks and uses recovery items, returns to spawn, uses portal scrolls,
and buys back when affordable. Actions are conditional on a useful opportunity,
so one match need not exercise every mechanic. Its observation scans are bounded
and its main decisions run every six ticks. Abilities and items require
explicit policy commands; the engine never casts or uses them automatically.
Spell ranges and shapes are not queryable, so their small policy table must
follow balance changes in `content.nim`; health, damage, costs, and ranks use
live observations. This is an editable starting point, not an optimal policy.

Every hero has a free single-target melee or ranged basic attack in addition
to four abilities. Basic damage grows each level and includes equipment bonuses.
Idle heroes automatically acquire the nearest visible, attackable enemy,
including enemy creeps, heroes, and exposed buildings. `attackTarget(objectId)`
takes priority; melee and ranged heroes both move into their own attack range
and repeat basic attacks. `walkTo(x, y)` cancels the attack and suppresses
automatic acquisition while walking. Basic attacks do not spend mana or spell
charges.

`attackMove(x, y)` uses the same attack-move order as the player controls. It follows a path toward that tile, stops for enemies in the hero's normal acquisition range, and resumes afterward. Like other actions, it returns 1 when accepted and 0 when rejected, and is recorded in replays.

The bundled `players/rusher.bas` sends all five heroes down mid together. It regroups toward the living team's center when any pair is more than 10 tiles apart, closing to 8 tiles before resuming. It attacks visible, vulnerable enemies within 20 tiles, favoring the enemy closest to the group's center. Otherwise it attack-moves through the middle and toward the opposing god. Dead allies are ignored until they respawn. This policy uses basic attacks only; add explicit casting commands to use abilities.

## Drafting

Every live match starts with a shared pool of ten heroes. A seeded random
team picks first. Teams alternate, and each team's players pick in spawn
order. Each hero can be selected once across both teams. Combat, waves,
and the battle clock wait until all ten players have drafted.

Only the active player's BASIC script runs during drafting, once every
half second. Every player, including humans, has ten simulation seconds to
pick. At the deadline, the game picks a random available hero if the player
has not chosen one. The bundled base and rusher scripts try to fill
five roles: frontline, carry, mage, support, and fighter. This is a policy
preference, not a draft rule. Any combination of available heroes is allowed.
Their normal movement and combat logic runs after drafting.

| Data or command | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `drafting` | 1 during drafting, 0 during battle. |
| `draftTurnId` | ID of the player picking now, or 0 after drafting. |
| `draftPlayerCount()` | Number of players in the public roster. |
| `draftPlayerId(i)` | Player ID at zero-based spawn index `i`, or 0 if invalid. |
| `draftPlayerTeam(i)` | Team at spawn index `i`: Red 0, Blue 1, invalid -1. |
| `draftedClass(id)` | Hero class picked by player ID, or -1 if unpicked or invalid. Both teams' picks are public. |
| `heroAvailable(class)` | 1 if the class is valid and unpicked, otherwise 0. |
| `heroRole(class)` | Frontline 0, carry 1, mage 2, support 3, fighter 4, invalid -1. |
| `draftHero(class)` | Selects a hero on your turn. Returns 1 on success, 0 on rejection. |

`selfClass` is -1 until your pick. Class constants are `VanguardKnight`,
`Ranger`, `Arcanist`, `DruidWarden`, `DemonHunter`, `DeathKnight`,
`Crossbowman`, `Lich`, `Warlock`, and `Berserker`, with IDs 0 through 9.
Draft queries update immediately. Other sampled self data updates next
turn. `worldTick` includes draft ticks for action replay timing.

```basic
if drafting then
  for candidate = 0 to 9
    if heroAvailable(candidate) then
      draftHero(candidate)
      exit for
    end if
  next
else
  attackMove(mapWidth / 2, mapHeight / 2)
end if
```

`lastActionError()` reports `ActionNotDrafting`, `ActionNotDraftTurn`,
`ActionUnknownHero`, or `ActionHeroTaken` for rejected picks. Normal game
commands are rejected with `ActionDrafting` while players are picking.
In player mode, select an available hero in the drafting screen and click
**Lock in hero** when it is your turn. The current picker appears above
the hero grid. Picked heroes turn gray and show their player and team.
The countdown shows the active pick's remaining time. Space pauses or
resumes drafting, including the countdown. Drafting has a separate budget
of up to 100 simulation seconds for ten players. The configured `maxTicks`
and CLI duration flags limit battle time only, starting after the last pick.

## Ability progression

Heroes start at level 1 with one ability point and all four abilities locked.
Each hero level grants another point. Points remain banked until a command
spends them. `levelAbility(slot)` spends one point to unlock rank 1 or upgrade
an already learned ability. Slots 0, 1, 2, and 3 correspond to Q, W, E, and R.

Q, W, and E have four ranks requiring hero levels 1, 3, 5, and 7.
R has three ranks requiring hero levels 6, 12, and 18. Each additional rank
adds 50% of the rank-1 damage, healing, or mana restoration, rounded down.
Mana costs, range, charge capacity, and timing stay the same. An upgrade
preserves spent charges and running cooldowns. Pending spells retain the
rank they had when cast. Respawning preserves learned ranks and banked
points and refills only learned abilities.

Hero stats, including basic-attack damage, still grow automatically with
hero level. Ability ranks never increase automatically. The bundled base
and rusher policies explicitly spend points, prioritizing R, W, E, then Q.
Ability use requires explicit `castTarget` or `castPoint` commands, including
slot 0 and ultimates. Items require `useItem` or `useItemAt`. Custom policies
can bank points, choose another upgrade order, and reserve any ability. At
level 20, fully ranking all four abilities leaves five banked points.

| BASIC function | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `levelAbility(slot)` | Unlock or upgrade. Returns 1 on success, 0 on rejection. |
| `abilityPoints()` | Current unspent points. |
| `abilityLevel(slot)` | Current rank, with 0 meaning locked. |
| `abilityMaxLevel(slot)` | Rank limit: 4 for slots 0-2, 3 for slot 3. |
| `abilityRequiredLevel(slot)` | Hero level required for the next rank, or 0 at maximum rank. |
| `canLevelAbility(slot)` | 1 when alive with a point and the required level, otherwise 0. |
| `abilityDamage(slot)` | Damage per target at the learned rank, or 0 when locked. |
| `abilityHeal(slot)` | Healing per target at the learned rank, or 0 when locked. |
| `abilityRestore(slot)` | Mana restoration at the learned rank, or 0 when locked. |
| `abilityManaCost(slot)` | Mana cost of a cast, including while locked. |

These queries update immediately after commands and return 0 for invalid
slots. `abilityCharges(slot)`, `abilityCooldown(slot)`, and
`abilityRecharge(slot)` remain available. Locked abilities have no charges.
Upgrade actions and rejected attempts are recorded for deterministic replays.

```basic
if canLevelAbility(3) then
  levelAbility(3)
elseif canLevelAbility(1) then
  levelAbility(1)
end if
```

Player controls use Shift+Q/W/E/R, Shift-click on an ability, or its gold
"+" button to spend a point. The HUD shows current ranks, locked abilities,
and available points.

## BASIC observations

All bots in one decision phase observe the same starting objects and spell
warnings. Earlier bots' actions do not change later bots' observations in
that phase. New casts appear in the next observation frame. Own inventory,
ability costs, and command results still update immediately when a command
is accepted. Object and spell indices are zero-based and may change next
decision. Keep `objectId(i)` when tracking an object across decisions or
calling `attackTarget`, rather than keeping its list index.

Observations are integers. `worldScale = 60000` is the number of world units per tile, and `tickRate = 24` is the number of simulation ticks per second. `selfX`, `selfY`, `objectX(i)`, `objectY(i)`, `spellX(i)`, and `spellY(i)` use whole global tiles. Facing, speed, range, and velocity retain sub-tile precision in world units. The Y component of these APIs is the second horizontal map axis, not height.

At an exact tile boundary, Red observers select the higher cell and Blue
observers select the lower cell. This makes observed cells rotate exactly
when the arena and teams are swapped. The bundled policies convert global
coordinates into their own team's frame before rounding spatial decisions.

Objects appear in groups: gods, buildings, heroes, then creeps. Within each
group, allies precede enemies, followed by position in the observer's team
frame and stable ID. This order does not depend on simulation storage order.
Spell warnings are ordered by impact tick, hostile before allied casts,
then team-relative position, ability, and stable caster/target identities.

Units plan movement and attacks from the same starting actor state. Movement
is published together, then spell impacts and collected damage resolve before
deaths and rewards. Opponents can kill each other in the same tick. Collision
corrections are also accumulated before moving any participant. Simultaneous
last-hit credit uses the match seed, tick, and team-relative actor geometry
and role, so corresponding fights do not depend on faction-specific IDs.

### Your hero

The existing `selfId`, `selfTeam`, `selfClass`, `selfX`, `selfY`, `selfHp`, `selfMaxHp`, `selfMana`, `selfMaxMana`, `selfGold`, `selfLevel`, `selfLayer`, and `worldTick` remain available. These additional read-only values describe the current hero:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `selfMoveSpeed` | Unblocked movement speed in world units per tick, including level and equipment bonuses. |
| `selfAttackRange` | Basic-attack range in world units, measured by planar Euclidean distance between centers. Towers and barracks allow at least 105000 units measured from their occupied footprint; gods use 255000 units. |
| `selfAttackDamage` | Current basic-attack damage, including level and equipment bonuses. |
| `selfTarget` | Current ordered or automatically acquired attack target's stable object ID, or zero for none. |
| `selfAttackCooldown` | Ticks until the next basic hit could land if the target stays in range. Includes remaining recovery and the next windup, or the remainder of a current windup. An idle hero reports a full windup. Excludes chasing and is separate from ability cooldowns. Movement can cancel a swing. |
| `selfAttacksLanded` | Lifetime count of successful basic hits, preserved across respawns. Spells do not increment it. |
| `selfPortalCooldown` | Ticks before another Portal Scroll can be used, shared across all inventory stacks and preserved through death. |
| `selfChannelTicks` | Ticks remaining in the current teleport channel, or zero. |
| `selfStunTicks`, `selfRootTicks`, `selfSilenceTicks` | Ticks remaining in these control effects, or zero. |

### Shop, potions, and spawn recovery

Purchases only work inside your own keep, including its spawn room. Elsewhere,
`buyItem(id)` returns 0 with `ActionOutsideKeep`. `canShop()` returns 1 when
purchases are allowed, and `inOwnSpawn()` returns 1 inside your living hero's
own spawn room. These queries read live state.

Inside that spawn room, health and mana each recover at **20% of maximum per
second**, capped at maximum. The larger keep and the enemy spawn give no such
recovery. Normal passive mana regeneration still applies. Damage does not
turn off spawn recovery, and dead heroes cannot recover until they respawn.

| ID | Item | Gold | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Health Potion | 30 | 120 health over 10 seconds. |
| 2 | Vitality Elixir | 75 | 90 health immediately. |
| 22 | Mana Potion | 45 | 90 mana over 10 seconds. |
| 3 | Mana Elixir | 90 | 60 mana immediately. |

Each stacks to **8** per slot. `useItem(slot)` spends one dose. Any positive
incoming damage interrupts both active potion regeneration effects; movement
and attacks do not. Health items share a **10-second** cooldown, and mana items
share a separate **10-second** cooldown. Cooldowns begin on use and survive
interruption and death. Full health/mana or a cooldown rejects use without
spending a dose. `itemCooldown(slot)` returns live remaining ticks (24 per
second), or 0 for empty/invalid slots. Inventory icons show stack counts and
remaining cooldowns.

### Portal Scrolls

Buy item **21** for **100 gold**. Scrolls stack to eight per slot. Call
`useItemAt(slot, x, y)` with whole or fractional map coordinates to consume
one scroll and begin a **3-second** channel. The destination is the nearest
visible, walkable point inside a living allied tower's sight radius:
9 tiles for outer towers, 9.5 for inner towers, and 10 for gate/guard towers.
Attack range, vision, and portal landing range share this same radius. Barracks are not
anchors. A distant requested point is clamped into this area; there is no
travel-distance limit. The selected tower must survive until arrival.

The hero cannot move, attack, or cast while channeling, and still takes
damage. Stuns, roots, death, or loss of the anchor interrupt the channel.
The scroll is spent when the channel begins. Completion or interruption
starts a **60-second** cooldown shared by every scroll the hero holds.
Damage alone and silence do not interrupt it. Blazing Blade, Golem Seed,
and Bone Marionette can interrupt the channel on impact.
`useItem(slot)` rejects scrolls because they require a destination.

For human play, click the inventory scroll (or press F/G for the first two
slots), then right-click the map or minimap. Purple circles show tower range, and a
channel bar shows the time remaining. Esc cancels destination selection.

### Visible objects

Loop over indices `0` through `objectCount() - 1`. Object kinds are 1 = god, 2 = hero, 3 = creep, 4 = tower, 5 = barracks, and 6 = neutral mob. Barracks have 950 HP and become exposed after their lane towers fall. Each barracks spawns three melee creeps and one ranged creep per wave, giving six melee creeps and two ranged creeps per lane for each team. Ranged creeps carry a staff and cast magic bolts from up to four tiles away. Destroying a barracks stops its four creeps from spawning. For creeps, `objectClass(i)` is 0 for melee and 1 for ranged. Destroyed buildings leave the object list and release their occupied tiles. New queries respect the same visibility filter:

| Function | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `objectLevel(i)` | Hero level. |
| `objectMana(i)` | Hero's current mana. |
| `objectStunTicks(i)`, `objectSilenceTicks(i)`, `objectRootTicks(i)` | Remaining control ticks for a visible unit, or zero. Uses the same frozen, LOS-filtered object list. |
| `objectItemId(i, slot)` | Hero's held item ID, using the same IDs as `itemId` and `buyItem`. Zero means no item. Slots are 0 through 5. |
| `objectItemCount(i, slot)` | Stack count in that hero's inventory slot. |
| `objectFacingX(i)`, `objectFacingY(i)` | Normalized horizontal facing, scaled by `worldScale`. A unit facing positive X reports `(60000, 0)`. |
| `objectTarget(i)` | Current attack target's stable object ID, or zero if absent or not visible to your team. |
| `objectVelX(i)`, `objectVelY(i)` | Actual displacement over the last simulation tick in world units, including collision adjustments. Stationary objects report zero. |

These new object queries return zero for invalid indices or fields that do not apply to that object. Invalid inventory slots also return zero. Hero level, mana, and inventory queries return zero for non-heroes. An object's ID is not a valid substitute for its list index.

Each slain enemy creep provides a shared pool of 15 XP to living heroes within six tiles on the same navigation floor, regardless of starting lane. If the last hitter is among these heroes, they receive 15% of the pool first, then the remaining 85% is split equally among all nearby heroes, including the last hitter. With three heroes, this gives 6.5 XP to the last hitter and 4.25 XP to each teammate. Fractional XP carries forward between kills. If no eligible hero lands the last hit, the full pool is shared equally. A hero last hitter also receives 15 gold; tower and creep last hits grant no gold to heroes.

### Pending spells and warnings

Loop over `0` through `spellCount() - 1`. This list contains unresolved casts from their start through impact, including projectiles and area warnings. Allied casts are observable; enemy casts require their aim position to be visible, matching the viewer's warning visibility. Completed effects are omitted.

| Function | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `spellAbility(i)` | Ability enum ID from `content.nim`, beginning at zero. Invalid indices return -1. |
| `spellCasterId(i)` | Caster's stable object ID, or zero if the enemy caster is hidden. |
| `spellX(i)`, `spellY(i)` | Aim/impact position or area center in whole global tiles. This is not the projectile's interpolated flight position. |
| `spellImpactTick(i)` | Absolute simulation tick at impact. Subtract `worldTick` to obtain the remaining ticks. |

Other invalid spell queries return zero. Visibility of an enemy warning does not reveal its hidden caster's identity.

## Death and buyback

The first death takes 9 seconds to respawn, including the 1-second death
animation. Each subsequent death adds 5 seconds, up to a total of 60 seconds.
Death counts belong to each hero and persist after respawning.

`selfDeaths` is the hero's death count. `selfRespawnTicks` is the remaining
respawn delay in ticks, or zero while alive. BASIC decisions continue while
dead so a policy can request buyback.

`buybackPrice()` returns the dead hero's price: 100 gold times their death
count. It returns zero while alive or after the match ends. The price stays
fixed during a death, even as the respawn timer counts down.

`buyback()` returns 1 when accepted and 0 when rejected. It spends the
hero's gold and immediately respawns them with full health, mana, and spell
charges. It preserves inventory, level, XP, and death count. A living hero,
an ended match, or insufficient gold causes rejection without spending gold.
The HUD shows the countdown, buyback price, and any rejection reason while
dead. Buyback attempts are recorded for replay and seeking.

The bundled `players/base.bas` buys back as soon as it can afford the price.
While dead it skips normal commands, resuming them on the decision after buyback.

```basic
if selfRespawnTicks > 0 then
  price = buybackPrice()
  if price > 0 and selfGold >= price then
    accepted = buyback()
  end if
end if
```

## Crowd control

| Hero | Ability | Effect | Rank-one damage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Vanguard | R: Blazing Blade | Stun for 1 second | 72 |
| Warlock | E: Dread Totem | Silence for 2 seconds | 70 |
| Druid | R: Golem Seed | Root for 2 seconds | 68 |
| Lich | E: Bone Marionette | Root for 1 second | 53 |

These abilities trade about 20% of their damage for control. Durations stay
fixed at every rank. Effects apply on impact to enemy heroes and creeps;
buildings and gods are immune. A stun stops movement, basic attacks,
abilities, and items, and cancels a pending basic swing. Silence prevents
all four abilities but allows movement, basic attacks, and items. Root
prevents movement and teleporting, while allowing in-range attacks,
abilities, and other items. Stun and root interrupt teleport channels.
Already released spells still resolve.

Different effects coexist. Reapplying one keeps the later expiration,
without adding durations. All effects clear on death and respawn. Visible
affected units show icons with countdown rings above their health bars.

## Action feedback

`lastActionError()` returns the reason for your hero's latest submitted
command. A successful action clears it to `NoActionError` (0). A failed
action returns 0 as before, and sets the first failing validation reason.
Read-only queries and automatic basic attacks do not change it.
Unlike the sampled self data, this query updates immediately after commands.

```basic
accepted = castTarget(1, targetId)
if accepted = 0 and lastActionError() = ActionInsufficientMana then
  print "Need more mana"
end if
```

Read-only reason constants are `NoActionError`, `ActionNotAlive`,
`ActionInvalidSlot`, `ActionUnknownItem`, `ActionInsufficientGold`,
`ActionAlreadyEquipped`, `ActionStackFull`, `ActionInventoryFull`,
`ActionEmptySlot`, `ActionNotConsumable`, `ActionFullHealth`, `ActionFullMana`,
`ActionTargetUnavailable`, `ActionOutOfRange`, `ActionNoRoute`,
`ActionInvalidPoint`, `ActionCooldown`, `ActionNoCharges`,
`ActionInsufficientMana`, `ActionSpellLimit`, `ActionChanneling`,
`ActionStunned`, `ActionRooted`, `ActionOutsideKeep`, `ActionAbilityLocked`,
`ActionNoAbilityPoints`, `ActionAbilityMaxLevel`, `ActionHeroLevelRequired`,
`ActionNotDead`, `ActionMatchEnded`, `ActionDrafting`, `ActionNotDrafting`,
`ActionNotDraftTurn`, `ActionUnknownHero`, `ActionHeroTaken`, and `ActionSilenced`
(values 0 through 35).
Unavailable targets share a generic error without exposing hidden state.
This feedback is recorded deterministically through submitted replay actions.

For post-match analysis, the [replay extractor](../../docs/stats.md#gota-replay-events)
resimulates an exact-version replay and exposes typed damage, healing,
death, reward, and rejection events for all players. Its omniscient buffer
is not available to live BASIC policies.

## Terrain and execution

BASIC can inspect the complete static terrain with `terrainKind(x, y)`, `terrainWalkable(x, y)`, `terrainHeight(x, y)`, and `terrainWaterDepth(x, y)`. These use global tile coordinates on `selfLayer`. Each has an explicit `At(x, y, layer)` version, such as `terrainKindAt(x, y, GroundLayer)`. Read-only constants expose `mapWidth`, `mapHeight`, `mapLayers`, the layer names, and terrain kinds. Height and water depth use eighths of a tile; invalid or absent tiles return zero. The Terrain API section of the game documentation lists all constants and edge cases. Static terrain is available through fog, while enemy objects remain visibility-filtered. Walkability also includes team-known building footprints; unseen enemy destruction does not reveal newly open tiles.

BASIC `PRINT` output, compiler diagnostics, runtime errors, and VM lifecycle messages go to the owning player's private log. Each log is limited to 10 MiB. Runtime limit errors disable that VM; other seats continue. Invalid BASIC syntax fails the episode with a player failure diagnostic. Public game logs and action replays contain no BASIC source or private print output.

Battles run up to 28,800 deterministic ticks (20 simulated minutes), plus drafting time, without real-time pacing. Replays run entirely in the browser with playback, seeking, speed, and loop controls. The server exposes `/healthz`; legacy clients are static stubs.

The Competition league schedules 24 games per round with random matchups,
on a 32-minute interval. Each match uses ten distinct policies when at least
ten are eligible: five different policies on Red and five on Blue, with
one hero per policy. The scheduler uses `team_n`, `team_count: 2`,
`team_layout: "blocks"`, `matchmaking: "random"`, and
`distinct_teammates: true`. Preserve these settings when updating the league.
Separate baseline filler policies complete short rosters and are not ranked
entrants. A policy controlling multiple heroes in a short-roster game receives
their average score, so extra seats do not multiply it.

Each player's round score is the arithmetic average of their game scores.
Standings use an exponential moving average: 15% of the new round score plus
85% of the previous standing. The first scored round sets the initial standing.
Higher standings rank first. Opponent ratings and win/loss Elo do not affect
either standings or matchmaking. For example, 3,000 lifetime XP after 10.5
simulated minutes gives a score of 900. A previous standing of 800 followed
by a round average of 1,000 becomes 830.

## BASIC numbers and coordinates

BASIC uses [Bassy](https://github.com/treeform/bassy) with [Fixxy](https://github.com/treeform/fixxy) Q16.16 decimals enabled. Globals and arrays retain fractional values across decisions. `/` performs decimal division; `\` performs integer division. Decimal operands must fit -32768 through 32767.99998. Integer-only calculations retain the full signed 32-bit range. When converting large world-unit observations, divide them as integers first, for example `(selfAttackRange \ 100) / (worldScale \ 100)` in GotA.

`and`, `or`, `xor`, and `not` are bitwise. Comparisons produce -1 for true and 0 for false; conditions accept any nonzero number. Host flags and action results remain 1 or 0, so use `flag = 0` instead of `not flag` to negate a host flag.

`walkTo(x, y)`, `attackMove(x, y)`, and `castPoint(slot, x, y)` accept fractional tile coordinates. For example, `walkTo(selfX + 0.25, selfY - 0.25)` selects a point a quarter tile from the current tile center. Integers continue to name tile centers. IDs, slots, indices, and terrain queries require exact integers. Passing a fractional value to an integer argument raises a BASIC error instead of truncating it. Accepted fractional destinations are preserved in action replays.

### Neutral camps

The 14 jungle clearings contain seven mirrored pairs. Each half has three
low, two medium, and two high camps. The map preset seed fixes each group's
appearance and size. Members share one chargen appearance, with one larger
leader whenever a group has at least two mobs. All neutrals use melee attacks.

| Tier | Mobs | Normal HP | Damage | XP | Last-hit gold |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Low | 1–2 | 100 | 8 | 20 | 10 |
| Medium | 2–3 | 180 | 14 | 35 | 20 |
| High | 3–5 | 300 | 20 | 50 | 30 |

Leaders are 35% larger, have twice the health, deal 50% more damage, and give
twice the XP and gold. Camps attack when a hero or lane creep from either team
comes within two tiles of a living mob and is in its line of sight. Damaging a
mob also engages the whole group. Idle auto-attacks ignore resting camps,
while explicit attacks, attack-move, and damaging spells can engage them.
Lane creeps can pull camps by approaching, and fight back once the camp engages.
Pulled neutrals can also be attacked by towers.

The group returns home if a member or the aggressor goes beyond 12 tiles from
the camp center, or the aggressor dies or remains out of sight for three seconds.
Returning survivors cannot be damaged or controlled. They heal fully when all
survivors reach home. Dead members stay dead until the whole camp is cleared.
The full group respawns 60 seconds after the final death, waiting longer if any
living hero from either team is within ten tiles, including the boundary.
Creeps and dead heroes do not block respawns. Respawns receive fresh object IDs.

Only the last-hitting unit's team receives neutral XP. Eligible living heroes
within six tiles on the same navigation floor split the pool. An eligible hero
last hitter receives 15% first; the other 85% is shared among all eligible
heroes, including that hero. Otherwise the full pool is shared. Only a hero
last hitter receives gold. XP contributes to the existing lifetime-XP score.

Neutral objects use `objectKind(i) = 6`, `objectTeam(i) = 2`, and
`objectClass(i) = 1`, `2`, or `3` for difficulty. Existing health, facing,
velocity, target, control observations and attack/cast commands apply. Units
are LOS-filtered through terrain and brush and grant neither team vision.

| Function | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `campCount()` | Number of public, static camp clearings. |
| `campX(i)`, `campY(i)` | Camp center in the usual team-relative map coordinates. |
| `campTier(i)` | Difficulty 1–3, or 0 for an invalid camp index. |
| `objectCamp(i)` | Zero-based camp index for a visible neutral, otherwise -1. |
| `objectLeader(i)` | 1 for a visible camp leader, otherwise 0. |
| `objectReturning(i)` | 1 for a visible neutral returning home, otherwise 0. |

Static camp queries never expose hidden living counts or respawn timers.
The reference policy farms nearby visible camps between lane fights, beginning
low camps at level 1, medium at level 4, and high at level 7. It starts with at
least 70% health, withdraws below 40%, and prioritizes enemy heroes and lanes.

`players/puller.bas` copies the reference policy and adds camp pulling. When
healthy and a nearby allied wave is available, it walks into neutral aggro,
then leads the camp through the wave without using offensive spells or items.
